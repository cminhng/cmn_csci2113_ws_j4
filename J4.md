1. You cannot extend more than one parent class in Java. If you wanted to have characteristics of multiple parent files, you can extend one file and implement however many interfaces you want.
2. Interfaces force you to override its methods, while for abstract classes, overriding is optional unless you specifically declare a method to be abstract. You can't have a constructor for an 
interface, but you can for an abstract class, even though you can't have an instance of an abstract class.

```
public void push(int v){
  addToFront(v);
}

public int pop(){
  return rmFromFront();
}

public int peek(){
  int front = rmFromFront();
  addToFront(front);
  return front;
}

public void enqueue(int v)(){
  addtoFront(v);
}

public int dequeue(){
  return rmFromBack();
}
```
4. 
```
public void push(T v){
  addToFront(v);
}

public T pop(){
  return rmFromFront();
}

public T peek(){
  T front = rmFromFront();
  addToFront(front);
  return front;
}

public void enqueue(T v)(){
  addtoFront(v);
}

public T dequeue(){
  return rmFromBack();
}
```

```
import java.util.HashMap;

public class TestHashMap {

    public static void main (String[] argv) {
        // Create a new hashmap.
        HashMap<String,String> fabFour = new HashMap<String,String>();

        // Insert four key and value pairs.
        fabFour.put("John", "John Lennon");
        fabFour.put("Paul", "Paul McCartney");
        fabFour.put("George", "George Harrison");
        fabFour.put("Ringo", "Ringo Star");

        // Use a key to retrieve a value.
        String fullName = (String) fabFour.get("Ringo");

        // Prints "Ringo Star"
        System.out.println(fullName);
    }
}

```
6. Erasure is when Type <T> is declared as an actual type in main(), in this case <String>. So everytime type T is invoked, it's 'erased' and replaced with String.
7. 
```
public class TestShelf {
    public static void main(final String args[]) {

        // TODO: Create a shelf to store Shakespeare character names:
        //       Hamlet, Othello, Cordelia, and Juliet
        
        Shelf<String> shakespeare = new Shelf<String>("shake");
        shakespeare.addItem("Hamlet");
        shakespeare.addItem("Othello");
        shakespeare.addItem("Cordelia");
        shakespeare.addItem("Juliet");

        // TODO: Then print the shelf.

        shakespeare.printShelf();

        // TODO: Create a shelf to store famous integers:
        //       13, 23, 42, 1729,

        Shelf<Integer> nums = new Shelf<Integer>("numbers");
        nums.addItem(new Integer(13));
        nums.addItem(new Integer(23));
        nums.addItem(new Integer(42));
        nums.addItem(new Integer(1729));

        // TODO: Then print the shelf.

        nums.printShelf();

    }
}

```
8. The marked line is inefficient because every call to get() has an efficiency of O(n). Meaning when get() is called for every single list item, the efficiency is O(n^2) which is not inconsequential for large n such as 100000. 
9. Expanding LinkedList to implement Iterable would mean that you no longer have to call .get() on each item you increment the index; instead each item can be accessed as you iterate and be operated on then. To execute an operation on every single item in the list, the efficiency would be O(n) instead of O(n^2). 
10. Comparable is an interface rather than a class because you should not be able to create a Comparable object. Further, in order for something to be comparable, it must contain a compareTo() method, meaning that it must force overriding.
11. 
```
public int compareTo(Car other){

    if(this.getTopSpeed() > other.getTopSpeed()){
      return 1;
    }

    if(this.getTopSpeed() < other.getTopSpeed()){
      return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
