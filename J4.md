1. You cannot extend more than one parent class in Java. If you wanted to have characteristics of multiple parent files, you can extend one file and implement however many interfaces you want.
2. Interfaces force you to override its methods, while for abstract classes, overriding is optional unless you specifically declare a method to be abstract. You can't have a constructor for an 
interface, but you can for an abstract class, even though you can't have an instance of an abstract class.

6. Erasure is when Type <T> is declared as an actual type in main(), in this case <String>. So everytime type T is invoked, it's 'erased' and replaced with String.

8. The marked line is inefficient because every call to get() has an efficiency of O(n). Meaning when get() is called for every single list item, the efficiency is O(n^2) which is not inconsequential for large n such as 100000. 
9. Expanding LinkedList to implement Iterable 
10. Comparable is an interface rather than a class because you should not be able to create a Comparable object. Further, in order for something to be comparable, it must contain a compareTo() method, meaning that it must force overriding.
